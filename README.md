# Hello 👋🏼

This repository is used to host my [`personal web page`](https://JayCrlt.github.io/JayCrlt.github.io/). So far it is split into 3 main sections.

🙎🏼 I'll share a brief professional summary and my most up-to-date [`resume`](https://jaycrlt.github.io/Papers/CARLOT_CV.pdf).

📚 I am also supporting the open access of scientific publications and all my studies are available in PDF format. I also share the code (via [R](https://posit.co)), if available, where I spend most of my professional time.

📸 You might also see some pictures from the different travels (personal or professional) I've been able to make. The closer the sea or ocean, the better I feel.

🎥 I plan in the future to build a new section about statistics and how to proceed with R - Probably late 2025.
